# Intro

I am an Asssociate at JP Morgan, where I work on pricing the securities for data commercialization. Before JP, I used to work at Goldman Sachs as a Senior Software Engineer. In my spare time, I enjoy investing in people and ideas through various platforms. I am particularly interested in projects with high social impact. If you think I can be helpful to you or your cause and would like to meet, please feel free to get in touch.

# Some history

- My parents put a computer in my bedroom in 2008 when I was 10. It was Windows Vista (then we got Windows 7) gifted by my uncle for my dad. My favorite game was Roadrash.

- I first sent email to my dad and it was "Hi Appa" (Not Hello World).

- I am from a small rural place in India where people could hardly afford Computers, so a lot of of my friends used to come over to play games.

- My brother used to run C program and I got really curious because I didn't know what was Programming language even!

- I have been taught Yoga and Abacus in my childhood and teenage.

- I was a tech savvy kid growing up but got into Computer science when I was 18 when I decided that I want to learn Computer science and the main goal for me to build an app which is so Cool!

- I got to know that before I build an app, its important to know core foundations of Computer Science.

- When I was 19, I built my first app to solve the book keeping system for milk management in rural areas, which was also my course project.

- From then, I wanted to explore different fields in Tech. I tried UX and Web development in the next sem. Machine learning and Deep learning in another sem. But overall, I liked Backend Development and occasionally front end as well than anything else. There was one thing which I hadnt done yet. Research.

- I interned in my 7th sem at Samsung as an AI researcher Intern for 6 months before covid hit.

- I lost my fulltime offer due to Covid-19 and started mentoring and freelancing. Also, started on writing blogs on Linkedin.

- Found a job at a startup in 2020 and got promoted to Software Engineer 1 in 6 months from Solutions Engineer.

- When the startup was about to lay off, it was time to leave and I found a role at Goldman Sachs and started as a Senior Software Engineer.

- I was asked to come to London from Bengaluru to work on-site and I moved to Birmingham (Had one of the best team experience in this company, just the best people!)

- When times were unstable in 2023, I left my job in Birmingham to join as a Software Engineer 3 at JP Morgan. I am currently working there :)

- Right now, I am mostly experimenting with a lot of AI chatbots, websites and white papers in my free time. It's so exciting!

Ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
